    <h1 align=center>Chapter 1. Geometry, Numbers and Sets</h1>

<p>

Ask someone what mathematics is about, and most of the time in
this day and age something to do with numbers will be mentioned
straight away (unless it's just "something I hated in high school
until I was allowed to give it up"). This is a long way short of the
whole story: Webster's (1997) dictionary sums this up, defining 
mathematics as

<p><i>
      1) the science of numbers and their operations, interrelations,
      combinations, generalizations, and abstractions and of space
      configurations and their structure, measurement, transformations, and
      generalizations.
</i>

<p>

There are numbers, for sure, and we will find them very useful tools
--- but mathematics is also "the science ... of space configurations
and their structure." This branch of mathematics is traditionally
known as geometry, and was rigourously studied some two thousand
years before the same exacting standards came to be applied to the
study of numbers. The Oxford English Dictionary, with its typically
traditional and didactic voice, recognizes this historical precedence,
defining mathematics as

<p>
<i>
    1. Originally: (a collective term for) geometry, arithmetic, and
       certain physical sciences involving geometrical reasoning, such
       as astronomy and optics; spec. the disciplines of the
       quadrivium collectively. In later use: the science of space,
       number, quantity, and arrangement, whose methods involve
       logical reasoning and usually the use of symbolic notation, and
       which includes geometry, arithmetic, algebra, and analysis;
       mathematical operations or calculations.
</i>

<p>

As this definition suggests, the traditional sciences such as
astronomy and optics found geometry to be an invaluable tool, as have
many other sciences, including music (understanding the relationships
between notes of different pitch), mechanics (understanding the path
of a projectile), chemistry and biochemistry (understanding the
structure of different atoms and molecules) and physics (one of whose
crowning glories, Einstein's <i>General Theory of Relativity</i>, is an
entirely geometric theory). Geometry has contributed much and
benefitted enormously in its interaction with these different
fields. The purpose of this book is to describe the way in which a new
interaction is developing between the study of geometry and the study
of language --- in particular, the study of meaning in the new and
practical field of natural language processing.  To begin this story,
it is important to consider the question, "What is geometry?" Why on
earth <i>should</i> the study of space configurations and their
structure be beneficial when dealing with meaning in language?

<p>

As well as introducing geometry, this chapter discusses some of the
relationships between geometric objects, other mathematical concepts
such as numbers and sets, and the way mathematical concepts have been
used to describe and model the world around us. Some of this chapter
(in particular, the introductions to numbers and set theory) are
partly for later reference. Any readers with little mathematical
background who find these sections difficult are urged <i>not to get
bogged down</i>. Much of the material in the rest of the book can be
understood, albeit less formally, without going into every bit of
mathematical detail. Also, some of the complicated-looking ideas and
symbols introduced in this chapter may become much more familiar
through being used in practical linguistic situations. Readers who
follow the gist but not the details in this chapter will probably get
more knowledge and <i>much</i> more enjoyment from this book by
pressing on to further chapters and referring back to different
sections in Chapter 1 as necessary. 

<p>

This health-warning aside, the next section which introduces geometry
itself is a must-read, <i>especially</i> for those who have a good
grounding in formal methods generally but are unaware of geometry and
its story. 

<h2>Sections</h2>

<h4>1. What is Geometry?</h4>

This section explains how pervasive spatial awareness is to the way we
approach the world, and how much we can predict just by considering
the relationships between objects. Examples include packing your
luggage, steering a car, and the phases of the moon.

              moonrise and moonset can be predicted by reasoning about
              the relative positions of three spheres.</i></td></tr>

This section also tells the story of Euclid of Alexandria who compiled
the <i>Elements of Geometry</i>, the most widely used textbook in the
history of the world.

<h4>2. Sets, Relations and Mappings</h4>

Introductory material on set theory, introducing the idea of sets and
the notions of intersection, union and complementation. Also describes
the relationship between geometric containment and logical
implication, Aristotle's fundamental link between geometry and
meaning.

<h4>3. Numbers and Ratios, Mysticism and Music</h4>

Why are numbers important? How do they describe the shapes of sounds
and crystals, the fundamental elements of which the universe is made,
and the orbits of the planets?

and water) ... and then a fifth was discovered by one of his pupils!

Some of these correspondences between mathematical patterns and the
physical world are well-founded, others are now seen as spurious,
history's reminder that we must be very careful when applying
mathematical models to real-world situations.

<h4>4. Numbers and Measurement</h4>

The main use of numbers in this book is to measure and compare
different observations. This process often involves choosing a
fundamental length (a unit) and a reference or zero point. These
choices are often more or less arbitrary, and vary for scientific and
often historical reasons.

This section also discusses positional notation (introduced by the
Babylonians some 3000 years before Hindu-Arabic numerals made it to
Western Europe). The symbol "3" can refer to 3 units, 3 tens, or 3
hundreds, depending on its position - one of the first examples of
systematic ambiguity we encounter, where symbols mean different things
in different contexts.

<h4>5. Different Kinds of Numbers and Measurements</h4>

Some measurements are continuous - however small an interval you
consider, there are always smaller divisionds you could make. Others
are discrete - the number of books on my desk is a whole number, never
a fraction. This difference corresponds to the difference between
digital and analogue desriptions.

Most measurements in this book are discrete - we deal primarily with
text, which has already been digitised or 'quantised' into a finite
alphabet of characters for representation in a computer. However, many
of the mathematical models used in the book are based upon continuous
mathematics.

<h4>6. Numbers in everyday language</h4>

Numbers are used to count all sorts of different objects. While
numbers are thought of as absolute and unchanging, they are among the
most ambiguous words we can use. Every street in the world may have a
house with the number 9 - so long as there are no two houses with the
same number in the same street or 'context,' everything is fine. In
mathematics, numbers may be absolute - in language, we have to rely on
a host of robust human conventions, and we are so used to this that we
don't even notice. Small wonder that it is hard to get computers to
respond appropriately to human language!
