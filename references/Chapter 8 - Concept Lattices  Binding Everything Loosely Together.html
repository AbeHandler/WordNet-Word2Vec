    <h1 align=center>Chapter 8. Concept Lattices: Binding Everything Loosely Together</h1>

<p>

This is the final chapter in our story, and it explains how many of
the mathematical systems we have encountered (hierarchies, vector
spaces, and logic) can be viewed as special examples of a
space called a lattice.

<p>
Much of the mathematics used in this book so far been rooted in
developments during a critical period in the middle of the nineteenth
century. Chapter 3 described the taxonomic approach to classifying
concepts, through the work of Charles Darwin and beyond to the
towering figure of Aristotle.  The chapters on vectors introduced the
geometric breakthroughs of Hamilton and Grassmann, themselves
influenced by the work of Descartes. Chapter 7 also described the
logic of Boole, which owes much both to Aristotelian logic and
Cartesian algebra and geometry.  These contributions, sharing many of
the same roots, have enabled us to explore concepts using several
exciting and diverse methods.

<p>
This process of branching out is very important and healthy --- ideas
that germinate in one field often bring insight, provoke questions and
take on new form in completely different fields. But diversification
can also lead to fragmentation, and some of the most important
scientific advances have happened when scholars realized that ideas
couched in very different terminology could actually be described by a
single unified model. The analytic geometry of Descartes (Section
5.3), for example, enabled problems in geometry (such as finding the
points where lines and curves intersect) to be solved using methods
from algebra (by describing said lines and curves by equations
representing the relationships between their <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
coordinates, and solving these equations to find the numerical
coordinates).

<p>
Broadening this unification into the physical sciences, Isaac Newton
went on to represent <i>time</i> as a coordinate, using <i>equations
of motion</i> to predict where a particle would be as a function of
time. The accurate laws that had been formulated by Galileo Galilei
(1564--1642) in the earthly realm and by Johannes Kepler (1571--1630)
in the heavenly spheres could then be understood as manifestations of
the same <i>universal law of gravitation</i>, which states that every
object attracts every other object.  More recently, the apparent
incompatibility between quantum theory and general relativity
(relativity is local, quantum theory non-local; relativity is
deterministic, quantum theory non-deterministic) has led physicists
beginning with Einstein to search for an underlying Grand Unified
Theory.

<p>
Our final chapter is about a distinctly twentieth
century branch of mathematics that weaves our previous threads together,
treating the hierarchies of Aristotle and Darwin, the geometry of
Hamilton and Grassmann, and the logic of Boole as different variants
of one underlying structure called a <i>lattice</i>. In a way, this is
fitting example for the historical process of divergence and
convergence we have described: the distinctive property of a lattice is
that any two elements can be <i>disjoined</i> (allowed to spread out
and diversify) and <i>conjoined</i> (woven together).

All this talk of twentieth-century mathematics and unifying theories
should not put you off: lattices are not particularly complicated, and
like many of the newest branches of scholarship, the ideas behind
lattice theory go back at least to classical Greece, and beyond this
to roots in astrology and mysticism lost beyond antiquity.

We will navigate through this chapter by considering the different
ingredients of a lattice in turn, starting with ordered sets (Section 8,1), examples of which include numbers, trees or
hierarchies, and some parts of Aristotelean logic.  Section 8.2 explains the <i>join</i> and <i>meet</i> operations
that make an ordered set into a <i>lattice</i>, examples of which
include numbers, lattices of sets, and vector spaces.  Section
8.3 introduces the theory of <i>Concept
  Lattices</i> (Ganter and Wille, 1999), which can be used to describe both
the way Aristotle portrays the four elements and the way a modern
interlingua (that of Janssen, 2002) represents words for
kinds of <i>horse</i>, both applications giving strikingly similar
models. Other examples show how the lattice operations give the lowest
common multiple and highest common factors in whole number lattices,
and eventually the disjunction (<i>OR</i>) and conjunction (<i>AND</i>)
operations in logic.  Finally, Section 8.4
surveys some of the opportunities for defining a suitable negation or
<i>complementation</i> operation on a lattice, again using vector
spaces and set theory as examples. This property distinguishes those
lattices which can be thought of as <i>logics</i>, the last kind of
space we will define axiomatically in this book.

<h2>Sections</h2>

<h3>1. Ordered Sets and Implication</h3>

An ordered set is a generalization of a taxonomy or hierarchy. It
consists of a collection of objects and relationships between
them. These relationships must be transitive (allowing you to form
chains of reasoning) and antisymmetric (so never circular). Trees and
hierarchies are naturally ordered sets, but they are very restricted
ordered sets where each object is only allowed to have one parent. If
we allow an object to have multiple parents, we can model much richer
structures, giving contextual as well as taxonomic information..

<br>

Logic is an important example of the use of ordered sets, and will be
returned to often in this chapter. In logic, the ordering on concepts
or propositions is derived from the concept of
<i>implication</i>. Aristotle's logic is the earliest well-documented
example, and its basic properties are described. In particular,
Aristotle noted explicitly that logical implication should be
transitive (if <i>A</i> implies <i>B</i> and <i>B</i> implies <i>C</i>
then <i>A</i> implies <i>C</i>) and never circular.

<h3>2. Lattices in Mathematics</h3>

A lattice is an ordered set equipped with 2 extra operators: a least
upper bound or <i>meet</i> and a greatest lower bound or <i>join</i>.

<p>

A beautiful example of a lattice is depicted below, in the diagram
that shows all the factors of the number 60 (that is, whole numbers
that exactly divide 60). This collection forms an ordered set, where
<i>A</i> is subsumed by <i>B</i> if and only if <i>A</i> is a factor
of <i>B</i>. The meet of two numbers in this lattice is their highest
common factor, and the join of two numbers is their lowest common
multiple. You can easily find meets and joins by tracing lines up and
down from the numbers you're interested in.

<br>

There are many important and interesting examples. In logic, the meet
of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> is the conjunction <i>A</i> AND <i>B</i>,
because it is the most general concept that is implied by both of
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. The join of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> is the
disjunction <i>A</i> OR <i>B</i>, because it is the most specific
concept that implies both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.

<p>

Set theory and vector spaces are also examples of lattices, and we
will see that they are the underlying lattices of different brands of
logic. In set theory, the join of two sets is their set union, and the
meet of two sets is their set intersection. In a vector space, the
join of two subspaces is the smallest subspace that contains both of
them, and the meet is the largest subspace contained in both of them.
The meet is the same as with set theory - it is just their
intersection. The join is however more general than in set theory,
because the join of two lines is not a cross-shape (the union of two
lines) but the plane containing them both (the cross-shape plus all
the lines joining any two points on the cross-shape).

<h3>3. Concept Lattices --- Elements and Features</h3>

What does any of this have to do with linguistics? Well, we have
already seen in Chapter 7 that the differences between Boolean logic
(based on set theory) and quantum logic (based on vector spaces) lead
search engines with very different though complementary properties.

<p>

However, there are deeper and older connections between lattice
theory, language, and modelling concepts in the real world. One way of
using lattice theory in this fashion is called <a
href="http://www.upriss.org.uk/fca/fca.html">Formal Concept
Analysis</a>, a technique that has become a significant branch of
mathematics and information science in its own right over recent
decades. The idea behind Formal Concept Analysis is that every concept
is represented by the following two things:

<ul><li>An <i>intent</i>, which is the set of attributes possessed by
a concept.  
<li>An <i>extent</i>, which is the set of objects that are
examples of this concept.
</li></ul>

For example, the intent of the concept <i>dog</i> includes being
furry, a companion, having four legs and enjoying going for
walkies. The extent of the concept <i>dog</i> includes the examples of
my dog Rolo and my parent's dog Plato. (Arguably not all dogs possess
the above properties, e.g., a few dogs get by just fine with three
legs, but this in general the properties we have stated are reasonably
accurate.)

<p>

This section of the book describes how you can used this information
to build lattices of concepts. Two example lattices are shown in
Figure 8.12. They include Janssen's example of kinds of <i>horse</i>,
and a much more encient example, which is given by Aristotle's
description of the four elements <i>earth</i>, <i>air</i>, <i>fire</i>
and <i>water</i> in his treatise <i>On Generation and Corruption</i>.
The structures described by Aristotle and Janssen are mathematically
identical!  The diagrams were drawn using Maarten Janssen's online <a
href="http://maarten.janssenweb.net/jalaba/JaLaBA.pl">Java Lattice
Building Algorithm</a>, which he designed as part of a technique for
building modern interlingua.

Such lattices enable us to answer questions such as:

<ul><li>Q. What do you know about a horse that is either a colt or a
        stallion? A. It's male.</li>
<li>Q. What do you know about a horse that is both female and young?
        A. It's a filly.</li>
</ul>

In this way, lattices can be used to model the traditional AND and OR
operators of logic, and in fact, being a lattice of this sort is part
of the modern mathematical definition of being a logic.

<h3>4. The Axioms of Logic --- Lattices with Negation</h3>

We've got implication, AND, and OR, so we only need NOT or
<i>complementation</i> and we've got a whole logic. This section
described the notion of complementation and expliains how it is used
to model negation in logic. The process gives different structures for
Boolean logic / set theory and quantum logic / vector spaces. And we
discover that the tools we have developed, though 20th century in
practice, were defined by Grassmann in 1862. This concludes the
formal material of the book.
