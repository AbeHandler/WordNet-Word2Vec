    <h1 align=center>Chapter 3. The Vertical Direction: Concept Hierarchies. </h1>


The previous chapter demonstrated a technique whereby a computer, with
a very little knowledge of the way English works, can tell us that
<i>hungary, poland, romania, bulgaria</i> and <i>czechoslovakia</i> are
all related. So far so good, but this begs the question, <i>what are
they</i>? The next step would be to have a technique for working out that
they are all European countries. Something like the following
    interactive demo (now deprecated):

Or if we want to know what <i>cheese</i> and its top five neighbours
<i>butter, milk, meat, bread, wine</i> from the left hand cluster in
Figure 2.6 have in common, we would like to be able to take these
words and classify them as follows:

Needless to say, there is an algorithm behind this class labelling
trick, and it relies on a lot of careful work by many Princeton
students over many years. The goal of this chapter is to describe this
work and the mathematical ideas behind it. The algorithm
itself is running <a href="http://infomap.stanford.edu/classes">here</a> and you're
welcome to try it out for yourself. Two of the most important
characters in this story --- Aristotle and Darwin --- are not usually
thought of as mathematicians at all, but nonetheless they described
their ideas using mathematical models which were, if anything, far
ahead of their time.

<p>

The idea is that concepts can be arranged into a <i>hierarchy</i>,
a tree of meaning whose trunk and branches correspond to <i>general</i>
concepts and whose twigs and leaves correspond to particular or 
<i>specific</i> concepts. We shall see that there are many examples of this
sort of structure in common use, from the famous 'Tree of Life' to
postal addresses and computer file systems. If the symmetric
relationships of the previous chapter can be thought of as level or
horizontal in character, the relationship between a child-node and a
parent-node in a hierarchy (most clearly exemplified in the
relationship between a species and its genus in the Tree of Life) can
be thought of as a vertical relationship.

<hr>

<h2>Sections</h2>

<h4>1. Phylogeny, or the Tree of Life</h4>

This section describes the way Aristotle and later Charles Darwin used
the idea of a tree to describe the way a species inherits properties
from its genus. Such a structure is called a <i>taxonomy</i>.

<h4>2. Directed Relationships</h4>

Such a collection of relationships can be represented as another kind
of graph, but now the links in the graph are directed rather than
symmetric. A good example of a graph with directed links is the world
wide web, in which the link structure can be used to give an estimated
measure of the popularity of different webpages. This is how Google's
original <i>PageRank</i> algorithm worked.

<h4>3. Antisymmetric Relationships and Trees</h4>

The relationships in trees are not only directed, they are
    <i>antisymmetric</i> - if <i>A</i> is an ancestor of <i>B</i> then
    <i>B</i> cannot be an ancestor of <i>A</i>.

<h4>4. Representing Linguistic Meaning in Trees</h4>

The idea of using a tree to represent meaning in language goes back to
Aristotle's <i>Categories</i>, a tradition that was followed by many
philosophers and artists.

<br><br>

Nowadays linguists use parse-trees to
represent grammatical structure of sentences, and semantic knowledge
bases contain taxonomies which are directly descended from Aristotle's
work.

<h4>5. WordNet</h4>

The most widely available linguistic taxonomy is the Princeton <a
href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/">WordNet</a>.

<br><br>

<table align=center border=3>
<tr><td align=center>

</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center width=600>Some of the uppermost nodes (major categories) in
            the WordNet noun taxonomy.
</td></tr>
</table>

<br><br>

WordNet has separate taxonomies for nouns and verbs, and organizes
modifiers (such as adjectives) into pairs of antonyms or
opposites. The insight that substances and actions often lack
'contraries' or antonyms, but that qualities normally have contraries,
is found explicitly in Aristotle's <i>Categories</i>

<h4>6. Finding class labels: Mapping collections of words into
WordNet</h4>

Coming full circle, this section describes the way we can use WordNet
to give a probably class label for a whole list of words. 

<br><br>

<table align=center border=3>
<tr><td align=center>
<image src="../graphics/countries-label.gif" width=600>
</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>The neighbours of <i>Poland</i> that we found in
            Chapter 2 are now classified as <i>European Countries</i></td></tr>
