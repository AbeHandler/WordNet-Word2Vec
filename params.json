This paper performs an empirical analysis of Word2Vec's determinations by comparing them to WordNet, a well-known, human-curated lexical database. It finds that Word2Vec tends to uncover more of certain types of semantic relations than others, with Word2Vec returning more hypernyms than synonyms followed by meronyms, hyponyms and holonyms. Moreover, it shows the likelihood that neighbors separated by distance k in Word2Vec are semantically related in WordNet.\r\n\r\n####Files\r\n\r\n`main.sh` Primary driver for the application.
